Homework 6:

For the Kundur system from the previous homeworks, we want to study the small-signal stability properties.
Assume a first order exciter control model with KA=50  and TA = 0.01 sec.
Assume Vrmin = -4 and VRmax = +4. Efdmin = 0 and Efdmax = 2.0.
For the governor model, assume that Tsg = 100 and Ksg = 1 with Psgmin=0 and Psgmax = 1 pu. R=5%.
Then carry out initialization and small-signal analysis for each of Type 1, 2 and 3 models.

1) Starting from the power-flow solution, initialize the steady-state values of all the dynamic variables.
2) Linearize the equations and find the system Jacobian matrix. You can use numerical differencing to compute the
    Jacobian entries numerically.
3) Find all eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
4) Compute all the participation factors and analyze each mode.
5) Design Power System Stabilizers (PSSs) as needed to render the damping ratios of all modes to be over 5% for each of
    Type 1 and Type 2 models. Assume KD= 2 pu for Type 1 and Type 2 model.

Homework 7:
Assume the system parameters as from Homework 6. We want to study a fault on one of the transmission lines between
buses 7 and 8. Assume a solid fault in the middle of the line. Assume Euler integration method with a step size of
1 msec.
1) For tc = 3 cycles, check if the system is stable.
2) Find the critical clearing time.
Repeat for each of Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3 models from your small-signal stability homework solutions.

Homeworks 6 and 7 are due on Friday 5/1/20 at midnight.
